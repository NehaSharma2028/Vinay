         not interchangeable.
        “Sex” refers to physical or physiological differences between male, female, and intersex bodies,
         including both primary sex characteristics (the reproductive system) and secondary sex
          characteristics (such as breasts and facial hair).
        “Gender” is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with a given sex;
         it is generally considered to be a socially constructed concept.
        Gender identity is the extent to which one identifies with their sex assigned at birth.
         In many Western cultures, individuals who identify with a role that is different from their
          biological sex are called transgender.
        “Human sexuality ” refers to people’s sexual interest in and attraction to others,
         as well as their capacity to have erotic experiences and responses.
