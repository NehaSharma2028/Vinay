       <b>Sex </b> 
     <p>
      <font color="red"> “Sex” refers to physiological differences found among male, female, and various intersex bodies. Sex includes both primary sex 
characteristics (those related to the reproductive system) and secondary sex characteristics (those that are not directly related to 
the reproductive system, such as breasts and facial hair).</font></p>

<u>     In humans, the biological sex of a child is determined at birth based on
 several factors, including chromosomes, gonads, hormones, internal reproductive anatomy, and genitalia. Biological sex has traditionally
been conceptualized as a binary in Western medicine, typically divided into male and female. However, anywhere from 1.0 to 1.7% of 
children are born intersex, having a variation in sex characteristics (including chromosomes, gonads, or genitals) that do not allow
them to be distinctly identified as male or female.

Due to the existence of multiple forms of intersex conditions (which are more
prevalent than researchers once thought), many view sex as existing along a spectrum, rather than simply two mutually exclusive 
categories.
